# Privacy Policy for RaterHelp

**Last Updated:** July 17, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the RaterHelp Chrome extension handles your data.

## Data We Collect and Store

RaterHelp is designed to work entirely on your local machine. All data generated or handled by the extension is stored locally on your computer using Chrome's built-in storage capabilities (`chrome.storage`). This includes:

* **Task Data:** Information about completed tasks, such as task count, Average Estimated Time (AET), and your real time spent. This data is used to populate your dashboard calendar.
* **Event Logs:** A log of the extension's automated actions (e.g., "Task Acquired", "No Tasks Available") for debugging and review purposes.
* **User Settings:** Your preferences for features like Smart Submit, Smart Reload, Dark Mode, etc.

## Data Sharing and Transmission

**We do not collect, transmit, or share any of your personal data.** All information remains exclusively on your computer and is never sent to any external server or third party. Your work data is your own.
