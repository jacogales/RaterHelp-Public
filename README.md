## Key Features

RaterHelp is packed with features designed to make your work easier and more efficient.

### Intelligent Automation
* **Auto-Acquire (ON / OFF / NTA Modes):** Automatically acquires tasks. The smart "NTA" mode only activates if you are coming from a "No Tasks Available" page, preventing it from grabbing tasks you may have intentionally released.
* **Smart Auto-Submit:** Automatically submits your tasks upon reaching a configurable AET percentage. This feature detects if you are typing to postpone the submission and prevent incomplete comments.
* **Auto-Reload:** When no tasks are available, the extension reloads the page at an interval you define.
* **Specific Task Automation:** Automatically checks common confirmation checkboxes and scrolls to the main work area of the task page.

### Comprehensive Dashboard with Statistics
* **Work Calendar:** Visualize your daily, weekly, and monthly activity in a modern, easy-to-read calendar.
* **Detailed Tracking:** Tracks the number of tasks, your total real time, and the total AET for each day.
* **Productivity Charts:** Analyze your performance with bar charts (Tasks per Day) and line charts (Real Time vs. AET).
* **Dark Mode:** Switch to a dark theme for greater visual comfort.
* **Multi-Language Support:** The interface is available in English and Spanish (automatically detects your browser's language).

### Data Management
* **Manual Entry:** Worked without the extension? Add or edit the data for any day directly in the calendar.
* **Data Export:**
    * **CSV Summary:** Download a daily summary of your work, perfect for spreadsheets.
    * **JSON Backup:** Export a complete backup of all your data (calendar and logs).
* **Data Import:**
    * **CSV:** Import data from other systems. The extension can read different formats and aggregate them into your calendar.
    * **JSON:** Restore a complete backup at any time.

### Customization
* **Quick Access Popup:** Control automation features and see a summary of your day without leaving your work page.
* **Flexible Settings:** Configure automation intervals and percentages to your liking from the dashboard's settings panel.
